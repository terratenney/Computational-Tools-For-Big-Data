This week we experimented with Deep Learning and neural networks using code to predict what an image is. We used various cat and elephant images to see if the program would guess correctly. This was all ran on a vagrant virtual machine. I have provided the python and python notebook files.
NOTE: I did not write these files nor is the code complete. We used and experimented with it.


Exercise 3:

In this exercise you will be using the Caffe Deep Learning framework to classify a picture of a cat, and a picture of your own choosing. We have provided a virtual machine (through vagrant) that has Caffe installed.
