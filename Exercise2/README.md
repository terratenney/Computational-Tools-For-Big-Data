Instructions for Exercise 2:

Exercise 2.1:

Write a script with two methods. The first method should read in a matrix and return a list of lists. The second method should do the inverse, namely take, as input, a list of lists and save it in a file with same format as the initial file. The first method should take the file name as a parameter. The second method should take two arguments, the list of lists, and a filename of where to save the output.

Exercise 2.2:

Write a script that takes an integer N, and outputs all bit-strings of length N as lists. For example: 3 -> [0,0,0], [0,0,1],[0,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,0,0],[1,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,1,1]. As a sanity check, remember that there are 2^N such lists. Do not use the bin-function in Python.

Exercise 2.3:

Write a script that takes a file (from a Kaggle competition), extracts the request_text field from each dictionary in the list, and construct a bag of words representation of the string (string to count-list).

There should be one row pr. text. The matrix should be N x M where N is the number of texts and M is the number of distinct words in all the texts.
