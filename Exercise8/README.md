Exercise 1:

Define and implement a MapReduce job to count the occurrences of each word in a text file. Document that it works with a small example.

Exercise 2:

Define and implement a MapReduce job that determines if a graph has an Euler tour (all vertices have even degree) where you can assume that the graph you get is connected. The euler.txt files have 5 graphs – for each graph, the first line tells the number of nodes N and the number of edges E. The next E lines tells which two nodes are connected by an edge. Two nodes can be connected by multiple edges.

Document that it works using a small example.

Exercise 3:

Implement the MapReduce job from the lecture which finds common friends. To test it out, use the example from the facebook_small.txt and facebook_combined.txt (note that for the Facebook files, you need to extend the job to convert from a list of edges to the format from the slides – do this with an additional map/reduce job).

Document that it works using a small example.

Exercise 4:

Make a MapReduce job which counts the number of triangles in a graph. Use the following graph roadNet-CA.mtx.

Document that it works using a small example.
