For this week I used SQL and NoSQL to solve a series of problems from a Database. I used SQLite and MongoDB.

Instructions for Exercise 5:

Exercise 5.1:

For SQLite: Establish connection to a database in Python (use the sqlite3 module). Document the connection by making some simple queries.

For Mongo: Start a running instance of MongoDB* (on command-line: mongod), then run the .sh file in a terminal. This should create a live Mongo database named ‘Northwind’ that you can connect to in Python. Document the connection by making some simple queries.

*Make sure you have MongoDB installed.

Exercise 5.2:

The customer with customerID ALFKI has made a number of orders containing some products. Query for, and return, all orders made by ALFKI and the products they contain.

Exercise 5.3:

Get all orders (with products) made by ALFKI that contain at least 2 product types.

Exercise 5.4:

Determine how many and who ordered “Uncle Bob’s Organic Dried Pears” (productID 7).

Exercise 5.5:

How many different and which products have been ordered by customers who have also ordered “Uncle Bob’s Organic Dried Pears”?

Exercise 5.6:

Of those products ordered by customers who have also ordered “Uncle Bob’s Organic Dried Pears”, which one has been ordered the most (by the same set of customers).

Exercise 5.7:

The customer with customerID ALFKI has bought a series of products. Determine which other customers have bought most of the same products (product types – 10 apples is no better than 1 apple).
